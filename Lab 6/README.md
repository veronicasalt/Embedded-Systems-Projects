# **ARM Assembly: Reversi (Othello) Game Optimization (Lab 6E)**

## **Overview**
This repository contains an ARM Assembly implementation of two optimized functions for the **Reversi (Othello) game**, developed as part of **Lab 6E**. The functions replace their original C implementations to improve execution speed and efficiency on an **ARM Cortex-M4** based microcontroller (STM32F429). 

The goal of this project is to enhance **performance-critical operations** in the game by leveraging **efficient parameter passing, function return values, and memory access optimizations** in assembly.

## **Project Description**
Reversi (Othello) is a strategy game where two players take turns placing pieces on an 8x8 board. The objective is to **capture and flip** the opponentâ€™s pieces by surrounding them with your own. The player with the most pieces at the end of the game wins.

The main program runs without requiring modifications, but two **performance-critical** functions are replaced with **ARM assembly implementations**:
- `int Between(int min, int value, int max)`: Determines whether a given value is within a specified range.
- `int Count(int cells[], int numb, int value)`: Counts the number of times a specific value appears in an array.

Each function must:
- Use **an IT (If-Then) block** for conditional execution.
- **Avoid PUSH/POP instructions** to optimize function calls.

These functions are defined as "weak" in C, allowing the **linker to automatically replace them** with their optimized assembly counterparts.

## **Learning Outcomes**
- ARM Assembly Function Optimization: Understanding performance trade-offs in function calls.
- Efficient Memory Access: Using auto-incrementing to streamline array traversal.
- Calling C Functions from Assembly: Bridging high-level and low-level programming.
- Game Logic in Embedded Systems: Implementing fast decision-making algorithms in real-time.


## **Key Features**
- **Optimized Comparison Logic (`Between`)**: Uses an unsigned arithmetic trick to eliminate unnecessary comparisons, improving execution speed.
- **Efficient Array Traversal (`Count`)**: Utilizes **pre-indexed or post-indexed addressing modes** to optimize memory access.
- **Minimal Instruction Set**: Reduces execution time by avoiding redundant operations.
- **C and Assembly Integration**: Demonstrates how to seamlessly replace C functions with assembly in an embedded system.

## **Assembly Code Explanation**
The two functions, `Between` and `Count`, are implemented in ARM Assembly for improved efficiency.

### **Between Function**
- Performs a single comparison instead of two, reducing execution time.
- Uses the IT block to execute conditonal logic efficiently.

### **Count Function**
- Uses auto-increment addressing (`LDR R2, [R0], #4`) for efficient array traversal.
- Minimizes branch instructions to improve execution time.

## Gameplay
- The game runs with green and red pieces on an 8x8 grid.
- Legal moves are indicated in white.
- User plays as green, computer plays as red.

### Game Controls:
- Place a piece: Touch a valid white spot.
- Let the computer move: Press the blue pushbutton.
- Restart game: Press the black pushbutton.
- Winning Condition: The player with the most pieces at the end wins.
